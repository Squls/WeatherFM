# WeatherFM

### Proposition

The Python script contained in this repository was devised to be used in conjunction with [Raspberry Pirate Radio](https://makezine.com/projects/raspberry-pirate-radio/) to create a FM radio weather repeater.

### Theoretical Installation

Place ```weatherfm.py``` in a parent directory on your flashed Raspberry Pirate Radio card.
Run the script:
```python weatherfm.py```

### To Do

* Test installation
* Script probably needs to cycle through multiple mp3 files
